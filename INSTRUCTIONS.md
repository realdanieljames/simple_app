# Riffy - Proposal

### Introduction

Today you're going to plan out a node app of your very own design. Just plan! But... really plan.


### The Basics

You'll be making a node app that uses `getInput` to take in input and `console.log` to provide output. And you get to pick what it does! There are some suggestions at the bottom of this readme, but you can _absolutely_ do something else. We'll be presenting these, so put your best foot forward!


### Workflow

Do not fork this repo. Simply create your own repo called "[app name]-proposal" and craft your plan as the README.md file.


### Your Planning Process

What we want for this planning phase is a plan/proposal/outline with the following sections:

* App Summary - what your app will do. Write it as if you're describing it to a lay person. Don't care about node or JavaScript; just what your app does for the user. Color Cleaver's might be, "Tells the user which colors combine to make their chosen color, or what color the colors they choose combine to make."
* App Logic - HOW your app does it. Color Cleaver's would discuss how it has a different if check for each color or pair of colors, and how it decides to combine or break apart depending on how many colors the user inputs.
* Stretch Goals - your own ideas for where you could take this app. Think of this as the ambitious version of your app. For Color Cleaver, it might mean being able to handle non-primary and non-secondary colors, or giving html color codes, or finding colors that work together into a palette. Be **very** ambitious here-- if you complete these goals, you weren't ambitious enough!


### Some Possible Apps To Make

Please feel free to use these ideas as jumping off points to something else, or expand them to something more challenging. In fact, please make the best, most feature-filled version of whatever you're doing. Now and always.

Please and thank you.

* Number Guessing Game

This app takes in two numbers, a max and a guess. It calculates a random integer from 1 to the given max (check out `Math.random()`!) and then checks it against the given guess, letting the user know whether they guessed correctly!

* Word Guessing Game

This app takes in strings and tries them against hard-coded answers. It might, for example, see if you can guess the birth-year of a particular celebrity by typing in their name and a year. Or which dinosaurs lived in which periods. Or anything like that that you know (or could look up) the answer to.


* Fahrenheit/Celsius Converter

Are we converting to Fahrenheit or Celsius? WHY NOT BOTH.  But then how many arguments do we need?  With Celsius/Fahrenheit it's always the other one, so we only need to know the _to_ direction, but we could even convert from or to degrees Kelvin as well. Then you would need a third argument--what are you converting _from_? An ambitious version of this app could convert not just temperature, but weight, size, length, etc., all with different units. Let the user decide!


* Bill Split Calculator

This app takes in an overall bill, a tip percentage, and how many ways to split it, and then calculates how much each party owes. For a really good version of this, you'd want to make the tip and how many ways to split it _optional_ parameters, so they could easily just figure the tip on their solo meal, or split it some number of ways with a default tip percentage.


### Other Ideas

Run ANYTHING else you want to do by us! As long as it uses some branching logic and isn't overly ambitious, we'll okay it! (We might even okay it even if it IS overly ambitious. Be brave!)

Happy coding!
